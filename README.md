## Website for a drum teacher

### User Stories:
- I need to view the page on a mobile device
- I'm looking for contact info or social media links
- I want to book a series/course of lessons as a gift
- I want to read some reviews from past students
- I want to watch a video demonstration of an example lesson

### Five Planes:

#### - Strategy (What this website aims to achieve, and for whom?)
The website aims to present essential information that the user stories request in a way that is visually appealing, professional and accessible



#### - Scope (Which features, based on information from the strategy plane, do you want to include in your design?)
The website should be clearly laid out with user friendly navigation to make the site easy to use and accesible. The colors, typography and styling should give the user an impression of professionalism. The user should be able to easily access links to social media, a phone number and a user-friendly contact form. There should be a page or section with pictures of the teaching environment and possibly video content of a performance or demo lesson.



#### - Structure (How is the information structured and how is it logically grouped?)
pages: Home, lessons, gallery, contact
